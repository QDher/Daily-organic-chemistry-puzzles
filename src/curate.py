"""Curation tool: atom hints and difficulty score for each problem in problems.json.

For each problem, the mechanism path is substrate -> intermediates (first form of each,
in order) -> product. Consecutive structures are aligned by maximum common substructure
(elements must match; repeated on the unmatched remainder, so a rearrangement that
splits the common substructure is still aligned). Three settings are tried for the first
fragment (any bond order; ring bonds only to ring bonds; exact bond order) and the
alignment with the fewest bond changes is kept (minimum chemical distance). Every atom keeps an
identity along the path:
  ("S", i)     atom i of the substrate SMILES (same index as in RDKit.js)
  ("R", k, j)  atom j of the k-th reagent that has a SMILES
  ("X", t, n)  heavy atom entering at transition t from a species without SMILES (e.g. water)
A bond is "made/broken" when a heavy-atom bond appears or disappears between two identities
(sigma change); a change of bond order between the same atoms is a pi change. H atoms are
not tracked. A reagent's own bonds count as pre-existing; a bond between two atoms that
both leave (e.g. inside Ph3PO) is not counted as broken.

Hints (3 undergraduate, 5 graduate, 8 advanced): atoms with a sigma bond made or broken between the substrate (with the
reagents) and the product, in the order in which the mechanism first changes them, substrate atoms
first; an evenly spread subset when there are more. Two atoms joined by a double or triple bond are
never both hinted (only the C or the O of a carbonyl, one C of an alkene or alkyne). Only when
fewer than the minimum (2) exist are atoms changed in single mechanistic steps added.

Difficulty score = 2 x (steps - 1) + intermediates + 0.5 x sigma bond events
                   + 0 / 3 / 6 for undergraduate / graduate / specialized textbook level.
